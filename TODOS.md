# TODOS Apr 8 - 10


* Collective
    * Figure out what stats we want to pull
        * Perf
        * Nsight compute
    

* Jack
    * Look at implmentations/relevant context for transformers 
        * Open source transformer models (huggingface) run it
    * C++ hook to load transformer-relevant data

* Chiyue
    * Script to pull stats from perf, Nsight compute
    * Push code to github
    * Test out Jack's code


* Russell
    * Push resnet code to github for models
    * Debug quantization models
    * Test out Jack's code



# Meeting notes

## Apr 8

* Decided to use nsight compute
    * What stats to use?
    * How to pull automatically
    * Do we need to compile w/ it for more granular or no? (think it's no?)
